# Garv Puri

Computer Engineering @ Texas A&M University (Class of 2027)  
Focus: backend engineering, security, and applied AI/ML.

I like building systems that are measurable: authentication flows with real risk scoring, services that hold up under load tests, and cloud applications that are actually deployable, not just classroom demos.

## Projects

- [LoginSentinel](https://github.com/garvpuri17/LoginSentinel)  
  Risk-based authentication platform using TypeScript, React, Node.js/Express, PostgreSQL (Drizzle ORM), and k6. Implements JWT authentication, rate limiting, and an IsolationForest-inspired anomaly engine with quantified detection accuracy and latency under load.

- [SecureCloudAI](https://github.com/garvpuri17/SecureCloudAI)  
  In-progress cloud security service built with Python, FastAPI, Docker, and MongoDB, exploring anomaly detection, API hardening, and containerised deployment patterns.
